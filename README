Driver file - TestRunner.java
Feature file - ComposeGmail.feature
StepDefinition file - StepDefinition

Alter the feature file with relevant email address and password
Change the path to driver accordingly in StepDefinition
And Change the path of attachment (dummydata) accordingly

Challenges:

1> Since upload attachment is not with tag name <input> sendkey(File path) method of selenium will not work
So, workaround is the use of Robot class

2> Confirmation message for "email sent" is a dynamic pop up whose element is shortlived (2 sec). Cannot inspect
the element
So, workaround is the use of java mail API which will consume time. Also gmail blocks the account sign in from
the code.
